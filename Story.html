        <p>My name is Hail Jahnna De Sagun and I was born on the 8th of
            September year 2002 in Las Piñas City, Philippines. I am currently 18
            years old, my Mother is Lodiemir De Sagun and my father's name is
            Johniss De Sagun. I am the 2nd to the youngest child of my siblings. I
            have 4 siblings and one of my closest siblings is my youngest sister it is
            because we already knew each other.
            <p>

            </p>
            My religion is Catholic and both of my parents are catholic too, my height is 5'1 inches and
            my current weight is 55 kilograms.
            My previous school when I was in elementary is Brittany School, and then when I graduated
            from Elementary, I moved to Las Piñas East National High School to pursue my Junior High.
            And my recent school in Senior high was Holy Rosary. And when it comes to favorites. My
            Favorite Filipino dish is "Sinigang" I like it so much. And my hobby recently was doing
            some paintings; I love painting because it refreshes me so much. When I'm bored painting is
            one of my favorite hobbies. Some people didn't know that I love being alone It is because for
            me being alone makes me feel relax.
            <p>

            I love it when my siblings and my cousin go to some places to try their food or
            to explore that place. We were always loved to travel to make a lot of happy
            memories. We will eat and talk about anything that will make us cry because
            of too much laugh. We always have unexpected travel because every time we
            have a group meet at our house, someone will say that they know a new food
            stall or restaurant that he or she would like to try. Therefore, we will go there
            to try it. Money isn't a problem to us; if someone has extra he will add to other
            people who do have not enough money.
            <p>

            The most unforgettable moment in my life is when I was 7 years old. I
            remember my mom and dad were celebrating the 7th birthday they bought
            me a beautiful gown and the theme of my birthday was purple and most of
            the visitors wore some purple and violet colors and up until now, I have
            some photos of my 7th birthday.
            <p>

            I am freshmen students taking of Bachelor of Science in Information Technology at
            Adamson University. And of course 4 years from now, I am looking forward to pursuing my
            dreams as an IT specialist
